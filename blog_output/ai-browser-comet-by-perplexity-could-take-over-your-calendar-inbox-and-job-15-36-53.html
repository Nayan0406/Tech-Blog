    <h1>AI browser 'Comet' by Perplexity could take over your calendar, inbox and job</h1>
    <p>**The AI Browser That's About to Revolutionize Your Productivity**</p><p>In an era where AI is increasingly becoming the norm, a new browser is poised to take the concept of automation to unprecedented heights. Meet Comet, the brainchild of Perplexity, an AI startup that's aiming to transform the way we manage our calendars, inboxes, and even our jobs. With its CEO, Aravind Srinivas, at the helm, Comet is being touted as a game-changer that could potentially render certain professions obsolete. But what exactly does this mean for us, and how does it work?</p><p>Last week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Srinivas, who walked me through the vision behind Comet. According to him, the browser is designed to function more like an operating system than a traditional search tool. This means that Comet can proactively anticipate and automate tasks that are typically handled by recruiters and executive assistants. Imagine having a personal AI assistant that can sift through your emails, schedule meetings, and even make recommendations for potential job candidates – all without you lifting a finger. It's a tantalizing prospect, to say the least.</p><p>Industry insiders are already buzzing about the implications of Comet. "This could be a major disruptor in the job market," notes Rachel Lee, a tech analyst at Forrester. "If Comet can truly deliver on its promises, we could see a significant shift in the way companies approach recruitment and talent management." Of course, there are also concerns about the potential job losses that could result from such automation. As Srinivas himself acknowledges, "We're not trying to replace humans, but rather augment their capabilities and free them up to focus on higher-value tasks." It's a delicate balance, and one that will likely be closely watched in the coming months.</p><p>As I reflect on my conversation with Srinivas, I'm left wondering what the future holds for Comet and its users. Will it revolutionize the way we work, or will it simply become another tool in our already cluttered digital arsenals? One thing is certain – with Comet, Perplexity is pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, and that's something worth paying attention to. As we continue to navigate the complexities of automation and its impact on our lives, one thing is clear: the future of work is about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p>
