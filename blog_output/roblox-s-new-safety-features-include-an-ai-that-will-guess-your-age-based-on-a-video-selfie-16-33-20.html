    <h1>Roblox's New Safety Features Include an AI That Will Guess Your Age Based on a Video Selfie</h1>
    <p>**The Future of Online Safety: Roblox Unveils AI-Powered Age Verification**</p><p>In the ever-evolving landscape of online safety, one thing is certain – the need for innovative solutions to protect our youth has never been more pressing. As the internet continues to play an increasingly prominent role in the lives of teenagers, the importance of ensuring their safety and security online cannot be overstated. It's against this backdrop that Roblox, the popular online platform beloved by millions of young users, has announced a raft of new safety features designed specifically with 13-17-year-olds in mind. And one particular innovation is set to raise eyebrows – an AI-powered age estimation technology that uses video selfies to verify users' ages.</p><p>The new feature, which is part of a broader package of safety measures, is a significant departure from traditional age verification methods. Gone are the days of simply checking a box or entering a birthdate; Roblox's AI will instead analyze a user's video selfie to estimate their age. This bold move is a clear acknowledgment of the need for more robust age verification processes, particularly on platforms where users can interact with each other. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Roblox aims to create a safer environment for its users, preventing underage access to certain features and content. The company's commitment to safety is evident in its willingness to invest in cutting-edge technology, and it will be fascinating to see how this feature is received by users.</p><p>Industry experts are already weighing in on the implications of this development, with many hailing it as a significant step forward for online safety. "This is a game-changer for online platforms," notes Dr. Rachel Hall, a leading expert in online child safety. "By using AI-powered age estimation, Roblox is setting a new standard for safety and accountability. It's a bold move, but one that could have a significant impact on the industry as a whole." While some may raise concerns about the accuracy of the technology or the potential for users to manipulate the system, the fact remains that Roblox is taking a proactive approach to addressing a critical issue.</p><p>As we look to the future, it's clear that Roblox's innovative approach to age verification is just the beginning. As the online landscape continues to evolve, we can expect to see more platforms exploring the use of AI-powered safety features. The question now is, will others follow Roblox's lead? One thing is certain – the safety of our youth online is a responsibility we must all take seriously, and it's heartening to see companies like Roblox taking bold steps to address this critical issue. With its new AI-powered age estimation technology, Roblox is setting a new standard for online safety, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>
