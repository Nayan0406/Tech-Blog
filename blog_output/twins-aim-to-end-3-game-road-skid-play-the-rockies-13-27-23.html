    <h1>Twins aim to end 3-game road skid, play the Rockies</h1>
    <p>**Twins Look to Bounce Back Against Struggling Rockies**</p><p>As the Minnesota Twins embark on their Sunday afternoon matchup against the Colorado Rockies, they'll be seeking to put an end to their frustrating three-game road skid. With a 47-51 record, the Twins are still clinging to third place in the American League Central, but their recent struggles on the road have raised concerns about their ability to compete with the league's top teams. Can they find their footing against the lowly Rockies and get back on track?</p><p>The Twins will face off against a Rockies team that's had a season to forget, with a dismal 24-74 record that leaves them languishing in fifth place in the National League West. Despite playing in the hitter-friendly confines of Coors Field, the Rockies have struggled to find any semblance of consistency, with their pitching staff sporting a collective ERA of 5.45. The Twins, meanwhile, will be looking to capitalize on the Rockies' weaknesses and get their offense back in gear. With a 3:10 p.m. EDT start time, the stage is set for a crucial matchup that could have significant implications for the Twins' playoff hopes.</p><p>From a pitching perspective, the Twins will be relying on their probable starter to shut down the Rockies' anemic offense. While the Rockies have shown flashes of power at the plate, their inability to string together consistent at-bats has been their downfall. The Twins' pitching staff, on the other hand, has been a relative bright spot, with a 4.42 ERA that ranks middle of the pack in the American League. If they can keep the Rockies' bats quiet, the Twins' offense should be able to do enough to secure a much-needed win.</p><p>As the Twins look to bounce back from their recent road woes, this matchup against the Rockies represents a crucial opportunity to regain momentum. With the AL Central race heating up, every win counts, and the Twins can ill afford to drop another game against a struggling opponent. If they can come out on top, they'll head back to Minnesota with renewed confidence and a chance to make a push for the playoffs. But if they stumble again, the Twins' postseason hopes may begin to slip further out of reach.</p>
